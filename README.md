Hello, my name is Kahnishga Solaidurairaj, and I am a first-year Computer Science undergraduate at University of Illinois at Chicago. From a young age, I have been drawn to creativityâ€”whether through art, design, or problem-solvingâ€”which led me to programming. I love building, experimenting, and pushing my limits through code, always looking for new challenges to expand my skills!!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new concepts and coding fun projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++

I mostly code projects with my computer science courses but when I have enough free time I like to pick up my own projects and improve previous ones ;) 
My other hobbies include crocheting, watching tv shows, and baking.
